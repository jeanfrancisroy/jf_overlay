Bumping udev-171 to depend of new hwids.


03 Feb 2012; Jean-Francis Roy <jeanfrancis@funtoo.org>

Bumping to udev-160-r3 and udev-171-r2 to revert to some upstream changes. We
now have gobject-introspection as an optional dependency to remove desktop
dependencies from Metro builds.

The "extras" USE flag will soon be removed by upstream. Now, introspection and
gudev can both be enabled by their respective USE flags, or by  the extras USE 
flag (see bug 348472) as several packages still depend on udev[extras].

When this is removed, packages will depend on udev[introspection], udev[gudev],
etc. We will have to stay in sync with upstream USE flags or this reason.
